            Talking about my strengths and weaknesses, my strengths are I am focused and dedicated to my work, I have a positive attitude and I have always been honest to myself and I am good at controlling myself and maintaining discipline in my life. My weakness is that I can not deny colleagues' requests whenever they ask me for help.
